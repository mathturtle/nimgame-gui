nimgame-gui
===========

A friend taking an AI class asked me to make a GUI for his nim game AI. This is the GUI without any of his AI code included.

This was written in 2010, but I just decided to put it up here now. This is a Java project in Eclipse and includes the Eclipse project file (but not the classpath as this can vary between machines).
